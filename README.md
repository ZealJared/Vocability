# Vocability
A vocabulary flash card application allowing teachers to build flashcard decks and have their students review and test their knowledge. The app presents a randomized flash card test on a specified deck of flash cards, keeping track of student scores and problem-words. Each card has accompanying image and sound, with test questions varying in style between being prompted by a word sound to select a matching image or being prompted by an image to select a matching written word.
